# AoC2022

## Description:
AoC2022 stands for `Advent of Code 2022`. It is a challenge that happens every year during December. It is an advent calendar of coding challenges! I decided to take on the challenge for this year and dedicate myself to completing the code challenges every day. Some days I chose to just do the problem in Python, and other days I choose multiple languages to complete the task in. I am wanting to improve my skills as a programmer, and I have found that this is a fantastic way to do it!
